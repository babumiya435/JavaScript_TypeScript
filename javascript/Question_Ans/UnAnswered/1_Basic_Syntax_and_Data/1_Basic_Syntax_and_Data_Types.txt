** 1_Basic_Syntax_and_Data_Types in JS **

Available Variable declarations in JS (Different ways of variable declarations vary variable scope accordingly):
    (Defines the scope of the variable define)
    without any declaration keyword --> (test;)
    var --> (var a;)
    let --> (let b;)
    const --> (const c;)

- without any declaration keyword
    - noKey = 5; 
    - will have global scope
    - (declaration + initialization unlike const variable)
    - trying to access this variable before decla + initi -> "ReferenceError: noKey is not defined"
    - no hoisting + no Temporal Dead Zone (no memory allocated before decla + initi)
    - not a good programming practice to use such varibales
    - uses : 1.Rapid Prototyping or Quick Scripting, 2.Debugging or Testing, 3.Legacy Code or Specialized Use Cases

- var
    - var a; var a = 5;
    - will have global + functional scope
    - hoisting (able to access variables declared using var before declaration)
    - memory allocation is done before declaration and initialized with 'undefined'
    - not a good programming practice to use such varibales as it can accessed/modified globally
    - uses: 
    
- let
- const
