** 1_Basic_Syntax_and_Data_Types in JS **

Available Variable declarations in JS (Different ways of variable declarations vary variable scope accordingly):
    (Defines the scope of the variable define)
    without any declaration keyword --> (test;)
    var --> (var a;)
    let --> (let b;)
    const --> (const c;)

- without any declaration keyword
    - noKey = 5; 
    - will have global scope
    - (declaration + initialization unlike const variable)
    - trying to access this variable before decla + initi -> "ReferenceError: noKey is not defined"
    - no hoisting + no Temporal Dead Zone (no memory allocated before decla + initi)
    - not a good programming practice to use such varibales
    - uses : 1.Rapid Prototyping or Quick Scripting, 2.Debugging or Testing, 3.Legacy Code or Specialized Use Cases

- var
    - var a; var a = 5;
    - will have functional scope
    - hoisting (able to access variables declared using var before declaration)
    - memory allocation is done before declaration and initialized with 'undefined'
    - not a good programming practice to use such varibales as it can accessed/modified globally
    - uses: 1.Function Scope, 2.Hoisting, 3.Global Scope, 4.Re-declaration

- let
    - let a; let a = 10;
    - will have block scope
    - partial hoisting (Until the point of variable declaration, variables will be in the temporal dead zone.), 
        once it is out of TDZ and memory will be allocated to let variable and hoisted
    - good practice to use.
    - uses: 1.Block Scope, 2.Preventing Variable Re-declaration, 3.Eliminating Hoisting Issues, 4.For Loop Iteration, 5.Constants
    - let status = "Pendign" as const

- const
    - const a = 10;
    - will have block scope
    - partial hoisting (Until the point of variable declaration, variables will be in the temporal dead zone.), 
        once it is out of TDZ and memory will be allocated to let variable and hoisted
    - good practice to use.
    - uses: 1.Block Scope, 2.Preventing Variable Re-declaration & Preventing Reassignment, 
        3.Eliminating Hoisting Issues, 4.Immutable Values, 5.Constants in Loops, 6.Object and Array Constants
    - let status = "Pendign" as const
