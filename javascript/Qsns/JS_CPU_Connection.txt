** JS code is executed by the JS engine, which is a part of the browser. However, in the background, all of this execution is handled by the client CPU where the browser is installed or running the JS code. **


Yes, you're correct. While JavaScript code is executed by the JavaScript engine, which is indeed part of the browser, ultimately, the execution of JavaScript code is carried out by the client's CPU (Central Processing Unit) where the browser is installed and running.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

JavaScript Engine Execution:

When a web page containing JavaScript code is loaded in a browser, the JavaScript engine within the browser interprets and executes that code.
The JavaScript engine, such as V8 in Google Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox, processes the JavaScript instructions, manages memory, and performs other runtime operations specified by the code.
Interpretation and Compilation:

The JavaScript engine may use various techniques, including interpretation and compilation, to execute JavaScript code efficiently.
Initially, the code may be interpreted to bytecode or an intermediate representation, which is then executed by the engine.
In some cases, portions of the code may be compiled to native machine code through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for improved performance.
Execution by CPU:

Ultimately, the instructions generated by the JavaScript engine, whether interpreted or compiled, are executed by the client's CPU.
The CPU processes these instructions, performs calculations, manipulates data, and carries out other computational tasks as instructed by the JavaScript code.
Interaction with Browser Environment:

Throughout this process, the JavaScript engine interacts with other components of the browser environment, such as the DOM (Document Object Model), rendering engine, and browser APIs, to provide dynamic and interactive web experiences.
